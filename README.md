# Team Go!
## Mission Statement
Make life more productive
## Problem Statement
As young adults begin to share living spaces away from their parents, household chores and tasks can begin to pile up. Responsibility starts to wean and finger pointing can start to occur. Based on our personal experiences and anecdotes from fellow college students, we have identified that current methods of house chore and task management among roommates are tedious and performed through inconvenient mediums.

Common solutions include using a chore chart and apps like Wunderlist have been pretty effective. However, these mediums do have their drawbacks. Managing a chore chart can be cumbersome and apps like Wunderlist require that all the roommates have the app. We would like our users to have a more convenient way to manage their chores.

## Communication Guidelines
1. Reply within hour or notify the person if you want to postpone
2. When asking a question, be sure to use @name. This will remove confusions; you may answer the question even if it is not directed to you if you are 99% sure about the answer
